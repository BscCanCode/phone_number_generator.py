## ðŸ“Œ About This Project
A script built in April, 2025, to generate a random 10-digit mobile phone number starting with 6, 7, 8, or 9, simulating a realistic format. Includes a success message for user feedback.

---

## Why I Built This
- To practice using `random` and `string` libraries in Python.  
- To learn string manipulation and type conversion.  
- To create a practical tool for generating test data.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does
- Generates a 10-digit phone number:  
- First digit (prefix) is randomly chosen from [6, 7, 8, 9].  
- Remaining 9 digits are randomly generated using `string.digits`.  
- Prints the phone number and a success confirmation.

---

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Using `random.choice()` and `random.choices()` for random generation.  
- Handling type conversion with `str()` to concatenate strings.  
- Generating random strings with `string.digits` and `join()`.
